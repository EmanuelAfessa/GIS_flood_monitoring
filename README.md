# GIS_flood_monitoring_mississipi river
We are establishing a relative elevation model (REM) for a river. This is a hydrological usecase. Rivers tend to meander over time. Floods, bank erosion, and other factors can change where the main channel flows. From the patterns in the terrain, we can discern previous paths and future erosion issues. REMs work well with large, slow-moving rivers that have meandered over time.[link](https://www.bluemarblegeo.com/relative-elevation-models-in-global-mapper/)


## Python Packages 
We discover new packages specically designed for geospatial projects.
* geopandas for vector data handling
* osmnx for downloading data from OSM (open streey map)
* xarray and rioxarray Working with geospatial data in xarray
* shapely.geometry 
* scipy.spatial for Inverse Distance Weight calculation

## USGS 3DEP data
This tile of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) seamless products is 1/3 Arc Second resolution. 3DEP data serve as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provide basic elevation information for Earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other applications.
