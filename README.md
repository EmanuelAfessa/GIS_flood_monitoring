# GIS_flood_monitoring_mississipi river
We are establishing a relative elevation model (REM) for a river. This is a hydrological usecase. The initial python package is Hydroriver.
## Python Packages 
Raterio for geospatial and xarray for multidimensional data.rioaxarray also exists. 
## USGS 3DEP data
This tile of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) seamless products is 1/3 Arc Second resolution. 3DEP data serve as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provide basic elevation information for Earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other applications.
